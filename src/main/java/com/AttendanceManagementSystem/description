MVC Architecture

Model/Sevice:-(used to write business logics)
View:-used for user interface by html template
Controller:- Request handling/Request process then give Response

Project architecture:- MVC
Technology:- Spring,Hibernate(it writes sql query automatically),JDK 21
front end:-Thymeleaf(To create dynamic webpages),JSP

Instead of DAO layer ,we use JPA repository which gives us methods to perform database operations(save,findAll)


@Controller:- To handle the request which is coming from the server but doesn't handle RestAPI for handling RestAPI we have RestController
